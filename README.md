# Pollination

Pollination is an open source batch simulation and visualization tool for running Rhino, Grasshopper, and OpenStudio/EnergyPlus paramtrics.  The simulations can run on a local windows instance or the "takeoff script" can be used to spin up an Amazon AWS cluster to run the simulations remotely and downloaded upon completion.

## Demo

See an example of the results [here](http://HoneyPatch.github.io/pollination/index)
