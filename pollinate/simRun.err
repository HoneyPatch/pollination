   ** Warning ** IP: Note -- Some missing fields have been filled with defaults. See the audit output file for details.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a zone sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Zone input object. SimulationControl Zone Sizing option ignored.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a plant sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Plant object input. SimulationControl Plant Sizing option ignored.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=0_0_1
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: InterZone Surface Areas do not match as expected and might not satisfy conservation of energy:
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual mismatches.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 1 coincident/collinear vertices; These have been deleted unless the deletion would bring the number of surface sides < 3.
